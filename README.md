Small demo Rust project to check .RESW files in a globalized application [Money Tracker Infinite](k-tech-systems.com):
- scan source code and print keys from reference RESW file that are not referenced anywhere
- check all other RESW files and print lines that are missed or not available in reference RESW file
- check all other RESW files and print lines that are not translated (comment starts with 'Check')
